          <h2 id="about-game">About the game</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>"Would you rather" is a conversation or party game that poses a dilemma in the form of a question beginning with "would you rather".</p>

          <p>The dilemma can be between two supposedly good options, two attractive choices or two supposedly bad options. The players, sometimes including the questioner, then must choose their answers. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the
            rules.</p>

          <p>Any number of players are invited to contribute to the game.</p>

          <p>There is no one certain way of playing this game. It is all about having fun. And it is most fun when you make your own rules. However, if you need some ideas to get started, here are some ideas below.</p>

          <h2 id="about-website">How to play the game on this website</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>On the <a href="index.html">Game</a> page, you will notice 4 cards. Each card represents a different type of questions set:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The first playing card with the &ldquo;Zombie&rdquo; image represents questions that are uncanny. The other players' answers may make you squint at them.
            </li>
            <li>
              The second playing card with the &ldquo;Puking poop&rdquo; image represents questions that may cause a rumble in your tummy.
            </li>
            <li>
              The third playing card with the &ldquo;Sunflower&rdquo; image represents questions that are possibly less controversial compared to the other question types.
            </li>
            <li>
              The fourth playing card with the &ldquo;Devil&rdquo; image represents questions that extremely naughty. These will for sure raise the hotness in the room.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Click on any card to reveal a question. Choose an answer from the given two options. Remember that you cannot choose neither or both options. Go round the table and let all players choose their answers. Now let the madness begin as you all
            debate your answers.</p>
          <p>Once you ready to move onto the next question, simply click on any of the four cards to reveal the next question and continue to choose and debate your answers.</p>
          <p>The questions will never repeat during within the same game session. If/When the questions list gets under any card gets exhausted, the card will turn grey and cannot be clicked to reveal questions further.</p>
          <p>When all questions behind all cards gets exhausted, all cards will turn grey and a "RESTART GAME" button will appear.</p>
          <p>You can also choose to restart the game anytime you like. Simply reload the webpage and it will start a new game session.</p>

          <h2 id="2-players">2 players</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Each player takes alternate turn to reveal a question. You can decide whether the person who clicks the card answers the question or the other player answers the question.</p>

          <h2 id="3-players">3 or more players</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Go round the table such that each player gets a turn to click a card and reveal a question. The player who clicked the card reads the question out loud. All other players then give their answers and explanations. The questioner then
            chooses who had the most interesting answer and that player gets a point.</p>

          <h2 id="drinking-game">Make it a drinking game</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>The questioner chooses which of the other players had the least interesting answer explanation and that person has to take a shot.</p>
          <p>The player with the least popular answer has to take a shot.</p>
