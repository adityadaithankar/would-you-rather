      <h3>
        <p>"Would you rather" is a conversation or party game that poses a dilemma in the form of a question beginning with "would you rather".</p>

        <p>The dilemma can be between two supposedly good options, two attractive choices or two supposedly bad options. The players, sometimes including the questioner, then must choose their answers.</p>

        <p>Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.</p>

        <p>Any number of players are invited to contribute to the game.</p>
